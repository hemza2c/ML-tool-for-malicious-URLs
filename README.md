# ML-tool-for-malicious-URLs
Machine Learning tool to distinguish malicious URLs from benign ones

I have developed a machine learning tool using Python and scikit-learn that can identify URLs based on Domain Generator Algorithms (DGA), widely used by command and control malware to avoid static IP blocking.
I have compared 3 different classifiers using the scikit-learn library, and show how the model parameters can impact the performance of the classifiers.  I used the following classifiers:
- Logistic Regression Classifier.
- Random Forest Classifier.
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier.
